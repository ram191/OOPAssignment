## #3 Log

Create `Log` class with ability to log text with several levels. 
The levels based on [severity levels in Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_level).

The `Log` class should be able to produce output to a `app.log` file, like so
```log
[2018-04-03T12:10:36.100Z] INFO: This is an information about something.
[2018-04-03T13:21:36.201Z] ERROR: We can't divide any numbers by zero.
[2018-04-03T16:45:36.210Z] NOTICE: Someone loves your status.
[2018-04-03T23:40:36.215Z] WARNING: Insufficient funds.
[2018-04-03T23:56:36.215Z] DEBUG: This is debug message.
[2018-04-04T04:54:36.102Z] ALERT: Achtung! Achtung!
[2018-04-04T05:01:36.103Z] CRITICAL: Medic!! We've got critical damages.
[2018-04-04T05:05:36.104Z] EMERGENCY: System hung. Contact system administrator immediately!
```

It would be great if you could create filter based on level, date, and messages.
For example filter by `CRITICAL` at `2018-04-04`.
